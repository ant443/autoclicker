# Project: autoclicker

## Description
Python3 script that automates clicking of mouse. Currently only right mouse button at 1k clicks per minute. It will listen for a hotkey to stop it.

## Motivation
I used to play a game which required the user to right click repeatedly to move a small creature around an obstacle course.
Rather than wear out the right button on my mouse, and since the author of the game condoned the use of such a script,
I decided to practice coding and make my own autoclicker(already many available).

## Prerequisites
Windows only. Only tested on Windows 7.
Requires Python 3 to be installed. Only tested with Python 3.5.3.
Keyboard and mouse.

## Installing
Clone/download repository to harddrive

## Usage
Run the script from command line:
cd to project folder in command line then type the following line and press enter:  
python autoclicker.py  
Or if that didn't work try:  
python3 autoclicker.py

To start clicking, press Start. To quit the program, press Quit.
Once Start has been pressed, there will be a short countdown and clicking will begin.
To stop the clicking, press z on your keyboard(also written on the button itself.
